        <p id="p2">Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (MLBB) is a mobile multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed and published by Chinese developer Moonton, a subsidiary of ByteDance. The game was released in 2016 and grew in popularity, most prominently in Southeast Asia.[4]

            At its base gameplay, the game puts 2 teams of 5 against each other in real time with at least 20-60 second matchmaking and 10-30 minute matches. Featuring traditional battle arena gameplay, players must fight over three lanes to take the enemy's tower and defend their own while securing objectives in order to pressure the opposing team. Like classic MOBAs, there is no hero training to level up or pay to play angleâ€”winners and losers are decided based on skill, ability, and strategy.[5]</p>
